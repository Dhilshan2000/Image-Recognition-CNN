Image Recognition CNN - TensorFlow

I have trained a neural network for image classification and improved its accuracy by adjusting hidden layers using different optimizers. Visualized the training data and the model's performance. Secondly, I have created a convolutional neural network with Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers. Ultimately, To reduce overfitting, I have used BatchNormalization, Dropout, and L2 regularization.
